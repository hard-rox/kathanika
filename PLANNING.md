# Project Planning for Kathanika

This document outlines the planning process for the Kathanika Library Management System project, including development phases, key features, and architectural decisions.

## Project Overview

Kathanika is a comprehensive library management system built with Angular frontend and .NET backend. The project aims to provide a modern, efficient solution for libraries to manage their collections, patrons, and day-to-day operations.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 19.x with TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Backend**: .NET 8.0/9.0 with C# 12.0/13.0
- **Testing**: Jest (Angular), xUnit (.NET), Cypress (E2E)
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS
- **API**: GraphQL with Apollo Angular
- **Documentation**: Compodoc for Angular, standard XML comments for .NET

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Set up project architecture
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Create core domain models
- [ ] Establish CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up basic UI components and layouts

### Phase 2: Core Features

- [ ] Book catalog management
- [ ] Patron management
- [ ] Circulation (check-in/check-out)
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Notifications system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Reporting and analytics
- [ ] Fine management
- [ ] Reservation system
- [ ] Event management
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization

- [ ] Third-party integrations
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced search capabilities
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Final UI/UX polishing

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: The application is built with a modular approach to facilitate maintainability and scalability.

2. **Clean Architecture**: Core business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns.

3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Core functionality is organized around business domains and their respective bounded contexts.

4. **CQRS Pattern**: Using Command Query Responsibility Segregation for better separation of read and write operations.

5. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage for both backend and frontend components.

## Testing Strategy

### Backend (.NET)
- Unit tests using xUnit
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Tests should mirror the main app structure

### Frontend (Angular)
- Component tests with Jest
- Service and utility tests
- E2E tests with Cypress

### Testing Requirements
- Each feature must include tests for expected use, edge cases, and failure scenarios
- Angular component tests must verify template behavior
- Minimum test coverage threshold: 80%

## Documentation Requirements

- All public APIs must be documented
- Complex business logic requires inline comments explaining rationale
- README.md must be kept up-to-date with setup instructions and new features
- Architecture decisions should be documented with reasoning

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning**: Define requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Implementation**: Develop the feature with tests
3. **Code Review**: Peer review with emphasis on quality and maintainability
4. **Testing**: Verify functionality across various scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Deployment**: Merge to main branch for deployment

## Future Considerations

- Internationalization support
- Dark mode / theming system
- Offline capabilities
- Mobile application versions
- AI-powered recommendations

## Progress Tracking

Development progress will be tracked using GitHub Issues and Projects. Each feature will be broken down into specific tasks with clear acceptance criteria.
